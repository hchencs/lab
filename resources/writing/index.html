They are far less familiar with your work than you. They may not be an expert on the topic and may not be able to afford much time on your paper.<li>The introduction should convey curiosity or excitement (new problem, new solution, improved solution, impressive results, or high impact), the design novelty, substantiality, and correctness, and the evaluation relevancy and comprehensiveness.<li>Conciseness: Remove every word that contributes no meaning, such as <code>kind of</code>.<li>Use proper tenses: <a href=https://www.unlv.edu/sites/default/files/page_files/27/GradCollege-VerbTenseScientificManuscripts.pdf>1</a> <a href=https://berks.psu.edu/sites/berks/files/campus/VerbTense_Handout.pdf>2</a> <a href=https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/effective-writing-13815989/>3</a></ul><h3 id=grammar>Grammar</h3><ul><li>Section titles should have consistent <a href=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/title-case-sentence-case/>capitalization</a>. I prefer sentence case.<li>Avoid passive voice unless strongly justifiable. Passive voice is ambiguous because it has no subject unless followed by “by…”. <ul><li>Bad: LLM was applied to fuzzing. (Who applied it? The authors or someone else?)<li>Good: We applied LLM to fuzzing.</ul><li>Avoid <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominalization>nominalization</a>. <ul><li>Bad: He made a proposal to use Rust.<li>Good: He proposed to use Rust.</ul><li>Avoid “There is/are”. <ul><li>Bad: There are many developers of Rust.<li>Good: Many developers use Rust.<li>Good: Rust has many developers.</ul><li>“Which” vs “that”: Use “which” in a nonrestrictive clause and “that” in a restrictive clause. <a href=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/which-vs-that/>More …</a> <ul><li>Wrong: Rust that is safe is popular.
